# Comparison of Machine Learning models applied on anonymized data with different techniques

**Author:** Judith Sáinz-Pardo Díaz (IFCA - CSIC)

**Abstract:** Anonymization techniques based on the application of different levels of hierarchies on quasi-identifiers are widely used in order to achieve pre-established levels of privacy. In order to prevent different types of attacks against databases it is necessary to apply several anonymization techniques beyond the classical ones such as _k-anonymity_ or _l-diversity_. However, the application of these methods is directly connected to a reduction of their usefulness in terms of their use in prediction tasks, decision making, etc. Four classical Machine Learning methods currently used for classification tasks are studied in order to analyze the results as a function of the anonymization techniques applied and the parameters selected for each of them. First, different values of _k_ for _k-anonymity_ are stablished, then, with a values of _k=5_ fixed three other methods are applied: _l-diversity_, _t-closeness_ and _basic β-likeness_. The anonymization process has been carried out using the ARX Software.
